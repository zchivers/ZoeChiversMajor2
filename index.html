        <h3>Significance of Album Cover Art</h3>
        <p>The purpose of album artwork is to capture the identity of the music within it. 
            Generally, the album cover is the 1st thing we experience before diving into the music, 
            & first impressions are critical in a highly competitive market, like music.</p>

            <h3>Personal Significance to Me</h3>
        <p>I love to paint! In high school, my little sister asked me to paint her a Lil Uzi Vert album cover - 
            ever since then, I have loved re-creating deffierent artists' album covers & discovering the meanings behind them as well.
            Here are a few of my favorites...</p>

        <h3>MEANING</h3>
        <p>This iconic album cover showcases ‘Dropout Bear’ being launched into the atmosphere after graduating from a fictional college in ‘Universe City’. The scene is vibrant & whimsical; it appears almost childlike. One of my favorite artists designed this cover – Takashi Murakami. According to Murakami, the cover is based on Kanye’s theme of student life: school and depicts a moment in life when you are finally (for good or bad) on your own upon graduating college.</p>

  <div class="item4">
        <h3>MEANING</h3>
        <p>Robert Beatty designed this album cover – he based it on a phenomenon called “vortex shedding” which is a term used in fluid dynamics & occurs when an object disrupts the flow of air or water. This abstract piece of art persuades the viewer to think about the album as an experience of form rather than a story or a scene, for example. The accompanying soundtrack contains a large amount of echo and reverb which I believe is also symbolized on the album cover.</p>

  <div class="item6">
        <h3>MEANING</h3>
        <p>Xxxtentacion’s album “?” is poetically gothic. The question mark symbolizes the theme of the album – confusion. Xxxtentacion projects some of his darkest thoughts in his albums, and the question mark represents his confusion in life. Xxxtentacion is obsessed with death, and this album cover represents the unknown that occurs after death. </p>
